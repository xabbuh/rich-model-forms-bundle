CHANGELOG
=========

0.9.0
-----

* The package has been renamed to `qossmic/rich-model-forms-bundle`.

0.8.0
-----

* The package is marked as abandoned and will no longer be maintained. Fix all deprecations and
  depend on the `qossmic/rich-model-forms-bundle` package instead.
* Deprecated the `SensioLabs` namespace, use the equivalent classes from the `Qossmic` namespace
  instead.
* Deprecated all services whose id starts with `sensiolabs.`, use their equivalent ids starting
  with `qossmic.` instead.
* Deprecated the `sensiolabs.rich_model_forms.exception_handler` tag, use the `qossmic.rich_model_forms.exception_handler`
  tag instead.

0.7.1
-----

* Fixed compatibility with `symfony/form` 5.3.

0.7.0
-----

* Allow the bundle to be used on PHP 8.
* [BC BREAK] When closures (anonymous functions) are used for the `factory` option, the submitted
  form data is no longer passed as an array, but each child form is passed as a single argument
  instead (use the `factory_argument` option of the child forms if form names and argument names
  of the closure differ).

0.6.0
-----

* Added a `factory_argument` allowing to use field names differing from the name of the actual
  factory argument (#82).
* Fixed using the `read_property_path` option with value objects (#89).
* Both the `read_property_path` and `write_property_path` options can now be used without
  configuring the other one (#88).

0.5.1
-----

* Fixed dealing with non-mapped fields when mapping to value objects (#81).

0.5.0
-----

* Fixed compatibility with `symfony/translation` 5.0.

* Allow to use the bundle with Symfony 5 components.

0.3.0
-----

* Added support for mapping several form fields to a single method of the underlying model.
* Exceptions thrown during instantiating value objects are now caught and mapped back to the form as transformation
  failures.
* [BC BREAK] The `ValueObjectTransformer` requires an `ExceptionHandlerRegistry` instance.
* [BC BREAK] The first argument's type of the `ExceptionHandlerInterface::getError()` method has been changed from
  `FormInterface` to `FormConfigInterface`.
* [BC BREAK] The return type of `ExceptionHandlerInterface::getError()` has been changed to `SensioLabs\RichModelForms\ExceptionHandling\Error`.
* [BC BREAK] A `TranslatorInterface` and the translation domain to be used must now be passed to the `FormExceptionHandler`
  instead of passing to the individual `ExceptionHandlerInterface` implementations.

0.2.1
-----

* Fix to actually use a configured factory when submitting non-compound forms.
* Fixed passing submitted data to the configured factory for compound forms.

-----

* [BC BREAK] renamed `SensioLabs\RichModelForms\ExceptionHandling\ExceptionHandler` to
  `SensioLabs\RichModelForms\ExceptionHandling\ExceptionHandlerInterface`
* Added a `PropertyMapperInterface` whose implementations can be passed to forms using the new
  `property_mapper` option to map data to forms and vice versa programmatically.

0.1.0
